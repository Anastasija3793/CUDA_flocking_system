# CUDA Fireflies Flocking System

Final year CUDA assignment representing fireflies flocking system. The serialized code is based on [2nd year assignment](https://github.com/Anastasija3793/FlockingSystem) and influenced by Craig Reynolds' work. However, it is modified in order to achieve the behaviour similar to a flock of fireflies.
